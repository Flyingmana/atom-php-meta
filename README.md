# Atom-php-meta package
does not target to replace other php packages for atom, but hopes
to provide some reusable stuff for them.

caution: current state experimental and incomplete

This package adds functionality for [PHPStorm Meta files](https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/PhpStorm/PhpStorm+Advanced+Metadata)
which describe possible arguments and their caused return types in factory methods.

An example of such an file for [Laravel](https://gist.github.com/barryvdh/bb6ffc5d11e0a75dba67).

This files are usually generated by some kind of script.
For example if you use Magento, you can generate such a file with [magerun](https://github.com/netz98/n98-magerun).

## current Status

while the parser for the meta file is already somehow finished,
we need a data structure to cleanly describe namespaces, classes and their methods.

For this we work on a independent container format with extensive testing as part of this repository.
But we hope others might be interested enough, so it can soon move to a more general php autocompete project.
